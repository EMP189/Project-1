# The javaSpread Blog
- This is our journaling website, where users can submit anonymous journal entries, view and comment on posts left by others on the site and react to their posts with a small selection of emojis.
We have also added the functionality of choosing a random gif related to your gif search query.

# Installation

# Technologies used
